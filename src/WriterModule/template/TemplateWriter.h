/// \brief This file acts as a template for creating file writing modules.
///
/// All of the classes required are explained here. The
/// only thing missing from this header file is the registration of the file
/// writing module which must reside in an implementation file. See the
/// accompanying TestWriter.cpp for instructions on how this should be done.
///
/// A file writing module comprises two classes. The first class is the
/// flatbuffer reader which must implement the FileWriter::FlatbufferReader
/// interface. The virtual functions to be overridden are called to verify the
/// flatbuffer contents and extract a source name and a timestamp from the
/// flatbuffer. See the documentation of the individual member functions for
/// more information on how these should be implemented.
/// The second class which you must implement is a class that inherits from the
/// abstract class WriterModule::Base. This class should implement the
/// actual writing of flatbuffer data to the HDF5 file. More information on the
/// pure virtual functions that you must implement can be found below.

// clang-format off
// Formatting disabled because of bug in cppcheck inline suppression.

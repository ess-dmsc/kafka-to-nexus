/// \brief This module contains instructions to write Module DATa about the file
/// via the filewriter, such as the start_time and end_time. The structure is
/// based on the existing WriterModules.
///
/// The class requires the FileWriter::FlatbufferReader interface.
/// The virtual functions to be overridden are called to verify the
/// flatbuffer contents and extract a source name and a timestamp from the
/// flatbuffer.
///
/// The second class which you must implement is a class that inherits from the
/// abstract class WriterModule::Base. This class should implement the
/// actual writing of flatbuffer data to the HDF5 file. More information on the
/// pure virtual functions that you must implement can be found below.
///
/// The call order is as follows:
/// \li WriterModule::Base::Base(..)
/// \li WriterModule::Base::init_hdf(..) or \li WriterModule::Base::reopen(..)
/// \li (multiple) WriterModule::Base::write(..)
/// \li WriterModule::Base::close()
/// \li WriterModule::Base::~Base()

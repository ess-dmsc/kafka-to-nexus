/// \brief This file acts as a mdat for creating file writing modules.
///
/// All of the classes required are explained here. The
/// only thing missing from this header file is the registration of the file
/// writing module which must reside in an implementation file. See the
/// accompanying TestWriter.cpp for instructions on how this should be done.
///
/// A file writing module comprises two classes. The first class is the
/// flatbuffer reader which must implement the FileWriter::FlatbufferReader
/// interface. The virtual functions to be overridden are called to verify the
/// flatbuffer contents and extract a source name and a timestamp from the
/// flatbuffer. See the documentation of the individual member functions for
/// more information on how these should be implemented.
/// The second class which you must implement is a class that inherits from the
/// abstract class WriterModule::Base. This class should implement the
/// actual writing of flatbuffer data to the HDF5 file. More information on the
/// pure virtual functions that you must implement can be found below.

// clang-format off
// Formatting disabled because of bug in cppcheck inline suppression.

  /// is accessed, all reads will end up inside the buffer. Implementing
  /// additional checks, e.g. determining if a value falls with in an expected
  /// range, is also possible here.

  /// FileWriter::FlatbufferReader::source_name(), thus somewhat defeating the

  /// expensive and it is currently not possible to set the application to not
  /// call this function.

  /// module and the name of the source of the data. This function is used to
  /// extract the name of a source given the relevant flatbuffer. Although the
  /// name can be as simple as a string contained in a flatbuffer, it might be
  /// appropriate in some cases to construct the name from (e.g.) a string and a

                              metadata calls block the application. Ex. "10s".

  --kafka-error-timeout       Amount of time to wait for recovery from kafka

                              the default. Increase the
                              "--kafka-error-timeout" instead.  Ex. "10s".

  --data-flush-interval       (Max) amount of time between flushing of data to

  --max-queued-writes         Maximum number of messages buffered for writing.
                              Directly affects the memory usage of the
                              application. The maximum is not enforced, only
                              used as guideline to throttle Kafka consumption.
                              Note that total memory usage will also depend on
                              the size of the actual messages consumed from
                              Kafka.
  -X,--kafka-config KEY VALUE ...
                              LibRDKafka options
  -c,--config-file            Read configuration from an ini file
```

### Configuration Files

The file-writer can be configured from a file via `--config-file <ini>` which mirrors the command line options.

For example:

```ini
brokers=localhost:9092
command-status-topic=command-topic
job-pool-topic=job-pool-topic
hdf-output-prefix=./absolute/or/relative/path/to/hdf/output/directory
service-name=this_is_filewriter_instance_HOST_PID_EXAMPLENAME
streamer-ms-before-start=123456
kafka-config=consumer.timeout.ms 501 fetch.message.max.bytes 1234 api.version.request true
```

Note: the Kafka options are key-value pairs and the file-writer can be given multiple such by appending the key-value pair to 
the end of the command line option.

### Sending commands to the file-writer

Beyond the configuration options given at start-up, the file-writer can be sent commands via Kafka to control the actual file writing.

See [commands](documentation/commands.md) for more information.

## Installation

The supported method for installation is via Conan.

### Prerequisites

The following minimum software is required to get started:

- Linux or MacOS
- Conan
- CMake >= 3.1.0
- Git
- A C++17 compatible compiler (preferably GCC or Clang).
GCC >=8 and AppleClang >=10 are good enough; complete C++17 support is not required.
- Doxygen (only required if you would like to generate the documentation)

Conan will install all the other required packages.

### Add the Conan remote repositories

Follow the README [here](https://github.com/ess-dmsc/conan-configuration).

If you are not building on CentOS 7, set compiler.libcxx to libstdc++11 in the settings section of your Conan profile:

```bash
# Assuming profile is named "default"
conan profile update settings.compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11 default
```

### Build

From within the file-writer's top directory:

```bash
mkdir _build
cd _build
conan install .. --build=missing
cmake ..
make
```

There are additional CMake flags for adjusting the build:
* `-DRUN_DOXYGEN=ON` if Doxygen documentation is required. Also, requires `make docs` to be run afterwards
* `-DHTML_COVERAGE_REPORT=ON` to generate a html unit test coverage report, output to `<BUILD_DIR>/coverage/index.html`

### Building and running the unit tests

From the build directory:

```bash
make UnitTests
./bin/UnitTests
```

### Running on OSX

When using Conan on OSX, due to the way paths to dependencies are handled,
the `activate_run.sh` file may need to be sourced before running the application. The
`deactivate_run.sh` can be sourced to undo the changes afterwards.

### Integration tests

The integration tests consist of a series of automated tests for this repository that test it in ways similar to how it would 
be used in production.

See [Integration Tests page](integration-tests/README.md) for more information.
